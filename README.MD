# CSE310 – Applied Programming

This repository contains the work completed for the **CSE 310: Applied Programming** course.  
Each module focuses on learning and applying different technologies through hands-on projects.

## 📘 Module 1: Rust Language – RESTful API

In the first module, the focus is on learning **Rust** and applying it to build a **CRUD Web API**.  
The project will demonstrate concepts such as:
- Structs, Enums, and Traits  
- Error handling in Rust  
- Web development with **Actix-Web**  
- Data persistence using **SQLite**  
- API documentation with **Swagger (utoipa or paperclip)**  

**Goal:** Create a fully functional REST API that manages resources using CRUD operations and is well-documented.

## 📱 Module 2: Mobile App Development

In the second module, the goal is to design and develop a **mobile application**.  
This project will apply concepts of UI design, data handling, and integration with external APIs or databases.  
Technologies may include **Flutter**, **React Native**, or **Kotlin** (depending on chosen platform).

**Goal:** Build a simple but complete mobile application that demonstrates core mobile development skills.

## 🎮 Module 3: Game Framework

In the final module, the focus is on **Game Development** using a modern game engine such as **Unity**, **Godot**, or **Bevy (Rust)**.  
This project will explore:
- Game loops and physics  
- Sprite rendering and input handling  
- Scene management  
- Basic AI or player interactions  

**Goal:** Develop a small playable game demonstrating the principles of programming, creativity, and design learned throughout the course.
