# Overview

This project is part of my journey as a software engineer to strengthen my skills across multiple programming areas — backend development, mobile application design, and game programming. Each module is designed to help me explore new technologies and apply what I learn through practical, hands-on projects.

The software in this repository is divided into three main modules:
1. A **Rust-based RESTful API** that demonstrates server-side development and database integration.
2. A **mobile application** that focuses on UI design, data handling, and API communication.
3. A **game framework project** that explores game logic, rendering, and interactivity.

The purpose of this software collection is to improve my understanding of software architecture, cross-platform development, and programming best practices by applying different tools and frameworks in real-world scenarios.

# Development Environment

The development environment includes:
- **Rust** for backend API development using **Actix-Web** and **SQLite** for data persistence.
- **Visual Studio Code** as the main IDE.
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and collaboration.
- Future modules will include:
  - **Flutter or Kotlin** for mobile development.
  - **Unity, Godot, or Bevy** for game framework exploration.

Programming Languages used:
- **Rust** (Module 1)
- **Dart** (Module 2 – Mobile)
- **Rust** (Module 3 – Game Framework)
